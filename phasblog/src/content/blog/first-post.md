As my summer term comes to an end, this upcoming fall I plan on focusing on making projects for my portoflio. As during a majority of the summer I spent the vast majority just sharpinging up fundementals and exploring frameworks. 

So far I'm looking to make a practical project that implents AI but I haven't had too much time to think about what would be worth making that would benifical to me or anyone I know for now. I'll get to brainstorming.

Something I do plan on experimenting with is a game to later release on steam. Just need to brainstorm charachters and what not, so far I've got a prodcer for sound, a writer (because I cannot write for shit) and a artist for visuals. Might make a simpler mini game using Phaser.JS or something just to pratice, because I want the finished steam product to be polished. Later in november or near winterbreak I'll rebuild my PC and probaly grind LeetCode super hard for my technical skills. Nothing too crazy, hopefully I lock in and actually follow through.
